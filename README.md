Give some profile link on deviant art, and it will auto download the highest quality image of all its public downloadable images.

Meant to be downloaded into one folder, and have a program cycle through the directory and periodically change the wall paper with one random one in the directory

config.json sample:
```
{
    "download_dir": "/path/to/where/you/want/to/download/to",
    "artist_profiles":
    [
        "https://www.deviantart.com/artist1",
        "https://www.deviantart.com/artist2",
        "https://www.deviantart.com/artist3"
    ]
}
```
